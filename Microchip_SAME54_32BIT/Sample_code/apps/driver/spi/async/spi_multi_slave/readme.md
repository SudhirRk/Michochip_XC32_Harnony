# SPI Driver asynchronous - multi slave

This example demonstrates how to use single instance of the SPI driver in asynchronous mode to communicate with multiple EEPROMs.

## Description

This example write and read data to and from two separate EEPROM connected over the same SPI bus by using the multi client feature of the driver.The example also demonstrates how to setup two different EEPROM transfers at different baud rates.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/core_apps_sam_d5x_e5x) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/driver/spi/async/spi_multi_slave/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

### Setting up [SAM E54 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsame54-xpro)

- To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
  - Two [EEPROM 4 click boards](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-4-click)
  - Two [mikroBUS Xplained Pro boards](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO)

- Install [EEPROM 4 click boards](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-4-click) on to the [mikroBUS Xplained Pro boards](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO)
- Connect the [mikroBUS Xplained Pro boards](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO) on EXT2 and EXT3 headers
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. The LED indicates success or failure
    - The LED turns ON when the data read from the EEPROMs matches with the data written to the EEPROMs.

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [SAM E54 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsame54-xpro) | LED0 |
